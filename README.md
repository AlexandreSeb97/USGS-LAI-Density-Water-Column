# USGS-LAI-Density-Water-Column

This project will involve modifying the Water Column code to support a spatially variable drag coefficient. This variable drag coefficient will be used to characterize variable vegetation density data from USGS. The said variable density is a taken as a function of Leaf Area Index (LAI). As such this tool will help simulate the water column characteristics of a marsh site under different forcings from itsâ€™ LAI.
